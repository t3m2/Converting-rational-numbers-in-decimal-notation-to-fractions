# Converting rational numbers in decimal notation to fractions
This repository contains a Python program that converts [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number), in [decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal), to [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)) in form _n_/_m_ where _n_ and _m_ are [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).

For example: -2.5(37) = -2.537373737373737... = -1256/495.

This is particularly useful when we have a [repeating decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) and want to write it as a fraction. For instance, the number 825.27(123) is equal to which fraction (in form _n_/_m_ where both _n_ and _m_ are integers)? You can [use the program to find out](https://github.com/t3m2/Converting-rational-numbers-in-decimal-notation-to-fractions/blob/master/main.py). :)

This only works with rational numbers because [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) are all the numbers and the only numbers that can be written as the divison of two integers, that's the definition of rational numbers. Note that [recurring decimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) (dízimas infinitas periódicas) are rational numbers, and that [0,(9)=1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...).

I created:
- [x] a file called [convert_decimals_to_fractions.py](https://github.com/t3m2/Converting-rational-numbers-in-decimal-notation-to-fractions/blob/master/convert_decimals_to_fractions.py) where I defined the functions needed and explained the process in the comments;

- [x] a program called [main.py](https://github.com/t3m2/Converting-rational-numbers-in-decimal-notation-to-fractions/blob/master/main.py)  which can be used to convert rational numbers (in decimal notation) to fractions by using *convert_decimals_to_fractions*;

- [x] a file called [.replit](https://github.com/t3m2/Converting-rational-numbers-in-decimal-notation-to-fractions/blob/master/.replit) in which I "tell" [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) what to do if you [run this repo on Repl.it](https://repl.it/github/t3m2/Converts-decimal-rational-numbers-to-fractions). (Although I didn't have to, because the main program is called main.py.)

Check [the main program](https://github.com/t3m2/Converting-rational-numbers-in-decimal-notation-to-fractions/blob/master/main.py) for more information, since the comments explain how it works.
