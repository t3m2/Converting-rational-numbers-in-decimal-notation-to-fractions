# Converts-decimal-rational-numbers-to-fractions
This repository contains a Python program that converts rational numbers, in decimal notation, to fractions in form _n_/_m_ where _n_ and _m_ are integers.

For example: -4.3(7) = -4.377777777... = -197/45.

This is particularly useful when we have a repeating decimal and want to write it as a fraction. For instance, the number 825.27(123) is equal to which fraction (in form _n_/_m_ where both _n_ and _m_ are integers)? Check the program to find out. 

Check the program for more information.
