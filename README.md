# Converts decimal rational numbers to fractions

This repository contains a Python program that converts [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number), in [decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal), to [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)) in form _n_/_m_ where _n_ and _m_ are [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).

For example: -4.3(7) = -4.377777777... = -197/45.

This is particularly useful when we have a [repeating decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) and want to write it as a fraction. For instance, the number 825.27(123) is equal to which fraction (in form _n_/_m_ where both _n_ and _m_ are integers)? You can use the program to find out. :)

This only works with rational numbers because [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) are all the numbers and the only numbers that can be written as the divison of two integers, that's the definition of rational numbers. Note that [recurring decimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) (dízimas infinitas periódicas) are rational numbers, and that [0,(9)=1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...).

Check the program for more information, since the comments explain how it works.
