# Converts-decimal-rational-numbers-to-fractions
This repository contains a Python program that converts rational numbers in decimal form to fractions.

For example: -4.3(7) = -4.377777777... = -197/45.

This is particularly useful when we have a repeating decimal and want to write it as a fraction.

Check the program for more information.
